mongoPHP
========

mongoPHP is a simple PHP based MongoDB administration tool based on the GAS Framework. It is completely open source and maintained by Simon Fletcher (http://twitter.com/simonify).

Getting Started
===============

Once you have uploaded the files you will need to edit the site.xml file within the /_application/configs/ directory. You will need to change the mongo address value to your real MongoDB server's URL. Once this is done, you're good to go.
